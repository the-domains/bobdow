The front and top were covered a couple thousand superballs glued to individual magnets. The side is covered in those glass jewels that had random weird paper punched photos also glued to magnets.   
I wanted it to be an interactive move the pixels around thing... but people just wanted to rub themselves against it, which would make the superballs go flying about. About half of them glowed in the dark. Pretty cool and completely looney. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c550b238-c062-4149-b821-b8b8e79419c7.jpg)
